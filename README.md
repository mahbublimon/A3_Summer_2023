## Secure Cloud Network Architecture for Multi-Tier Application <br/>

## Project Overview

In today's digital era, businesses are increasingly relying on cloud-based solutions to host their applications and services. However, maintaining a robust network architecture and ensuring the data security of these cloud-based multi-tier applications remains a significant challenge. 

This project proposes to provide services as a cloud service provider in Bangladesh. In this project, we will focus on developing a network with AWS services for an organization (as per their requirements manually). Other than that, for future work we plan on an automatic service so that organizations and business owners can easily deploy their web server, streaming server, etc. with proper data security and network segmentation.
